        <p class="project-paragraph fontMedium">The Boulder Convention Center is my favorite piece of concept architecture I created during my undergraduate studies.The design process began through a series of program studies looking at the implications of various spacial configurations, this process was entirely removed from aesthetics, we were purely looking at the functional aspects of organizing 3d space. One of my goals was to create a geometric form and system that required the use of multiple digital-fabrication mediums in conjunction with one another, in other words I really wanted to play with all the tools at my disposal.</p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20004747" width="950" height="533" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
