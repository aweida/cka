    <h3 class="project-title">Tool Path Automation</h3>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph fontMedium">A scripting process produced for an interior ceiling system arrays a set of planes horizontal to a free-form surface, generating a subsequent array of intersecting lines. The resulting lines are closed into planar curves and extruded to produce the ceiling system. Documentation is auto-generated by remapping the closed planar curves to a flat plane where they are dimensioned and given a unique id for assembly. This documentation is consistent with current digital fabrication processes in which each unique closed curve serves as an accurate tool path to be machine cut, numbered, and assembled. The systematic scripting-documentation process allows the designer to continuously alter the form and profile of the host surface and control various parameters such as spacing, dimension, and volume of components without needing to constantly update or change the fabrication and assembly documentation.</p>
