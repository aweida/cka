        <h3 class="project-title">Ambient Light Data Vizualization</h3>

        <p class="project-paragraph fontMedium">The Boulder Convention Center is my favorite piece of concept architecture I created during my undergraduate studies.The design process began through a series of program studies looking at the implications of various spacial configurations, this process was entirely removed from aesthetics, we were purely looking at the functional aspects of organizing 3d space. One of my goals was to create a geometric form and system that required the use of multiple digital-fabrication mediums in conjunction with one another, in other words I really wanted to play with all the tools at my disposal.</p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20039859" width="950" height="533" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

            <p>The is an excerpt of a process I completed while working at the Yazdani Studio.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Code is written to the Arduino micro controller asking for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal" target="_blank">anolog input</a> voltage streaming from pin (A0).</li>

                <li>The sensor plugged into pin (A0) captures the numeric values of light in the form of voltage ranging from 0 to 1023.</li>

                <li>The Code written to the Arduino micro controller grabs those values and sends them through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port" target="_blank">serial port</a>.</li>

                <li>The Processing code catches the values from the serial port and draws vertical lines based on the values, which in turn gives us a graphic representation of light</li>
